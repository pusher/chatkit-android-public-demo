## Getting Started

This app assumes you have some understanding of Chatkit, at the very minimum you should have followed the getting started tutorial at [https://pusher.com/docs/chatkit/getting_started/android](https://pusher.com/docs/chatkit/getting_started/android).

Depending on what you want to test Chatkit for, you need only do one of the following sections. We accept PRs for new use cases if there's something you'd like to see demonstrated :smile:

## Marketplace Use Case

Features
* 1:1 chat
* Other members presence update based on their online status

In the dashboard console you need to:
* create a user `buyer`
* create a user `seller`
* create a room `buyer:seller` - and add both the `buyer` and `seller` user to the room

Before you run the app you need to supply **your** instance locater in `ChatkitManager.kt`

## Contributions

We have a list of [open issues](https://github.com/pusher/chatkit-android-public-demo/issues) that require development work.

If you'd like to add your own use case section of the app please also update this readme with things a developer will need to do in the dashboard console to get started!

If this is your first time opening a PR and you'd like some support with getting, please reach out by tagging me (@daniellevass) and we can set some time up to get started together

Thank you :star:
